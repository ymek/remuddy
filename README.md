Remuddy - Redundant Multi-User Dungeon MUD

Remuddy is a playground which extends the multi-threaded GServer
provided in the Ruby stdlib.  There are many MOR servers like it,
but this one is mine.


Code is likely influenced by my experience with chef, rails, ROM,
Diku, Circle, and basically any ruby/MOG ever.  Titty Sprinkles.
